<pre>TCS Digital Question that I prepare for!
The first Question I prepared was printing the text "DIGITALHIRINGISEASY" in zigzag order like mentioned below,<br>
D     L     G     Y<br>
I   A H   N I   S<br>
G T   I I   S A<br>
I     R     E<br>

Here I solved this only by printing the text in order where we can by using some other things.

The order to be printed is

DLGYIAHNISGTIISAIRE


I had solved this question by using python. because most of the youtube channels solved it in some other languages but not in Python.
So, If anyone like to solve this question make use of source code.
